            <p>If you were paying attention in high school English class, you may have noticed that there are just a few differences between Shakespeare's <em>Hamlet</em> and the reddit post about dogs you read the other day while you should have been doing something more productive. While it might be straightforward to recognize that the language of the 1500's isn't the same as it is today, it still might not be obvious exactly <em>how</em> the words we use have changed over time, or perhaps even more interestingly, <em>why</em> they've changed.</p>

          <div class="col s5 push-s1">
            <p>Our team recognized these as interesting questions, and decided to try to answer them, but rather than tell you, we figured we'd show you. Using data from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/datasets/google-books-ngrams/" target="_blank">Google Ngram</a>, we will attempt a meaningful analysis of the millions of words used in centurys of English language books and show you the results, all neatly wrapped up in some pretty visualizations. Our work will focus on a representative body of popular works and will focus on specific phrases that emphasize trends nicely.</p>

                      <p>Sometimes books can offer us a window into the minds of the audience of the times. Often the literature of a period in history is a reflection of the attitudes of the readers of the time, and can offer us some insight into what people were concerned about.</p>

                      <p>Also of interest is how swearing in literature has gotten more popular over time. While perhaps not surprising, there’s much to be said for its explosion in popularity in the early 1960’s. This corresponds well with the many art forms that experienced a new freedom of expression.</p>

                      <p>Some changes in English grammar aren’t hard to perceive (not many people go around saying ‘thou’ these days) but there are several more interesting examples of trends present. For example, while it was once common to use the phrase “I’m well” (technically the proper response), you’ll find most people these days using the now synonymous “I’m good” in it’s place. You can also look at how our helping verbs have changed (ought has been supplanted with should or can), or how the use of contractions exploded in the late 1960’s.</p>

                      <p>Analyzing language in text allows us an opportunity to view history through the lens of literature. In these charts, you can see examples of usage of specific words or phrases that pertain to historic events or changes in culture. Beyond an obvious spike initially, it is sometimes noteworthy that certain phrases continue to be relevant, while others dip back into obscurity. Some even have ebbs and flows as their influence continues to resurge.</p>
                      <p>These trends can let us see how the literature of the time reflects what we’re talking about in our everyday lives. It can also let us see how these same conversations fuel authors to continue writing about them long after the initial trend happened.</p>

                      <p>
                        1900: The big buzzword automobile.  Two brothers, Charles E. and James F Duryea were the first Americans to manufacture
                         and market a successful gasoline-powered automobile. They were two bicycle mechanics and spurred on the nationwide 
                         sprint to start producing motored vehicles. This led onto the big companies such as Ford, headed by Henry Ford, who 
                         started the assembly line and produced the Model T as the first affordable automobile.

                       1910: In 1910 planes began to become popular. Aviators and Biplane are two buzzwords that can be seen in the Ngram-Data.
                       A biplane has two sets of wings placed on top of each other, and is the same design that the Wright brothers used when 
                       making their plane. Another popular word was taxi. With the incorporation of Yellow Taxicab Company in 1912 in New York, 
                       taxis became very popular for the wealthy and thus spurred on a lot of word traffic.

                      1920: Automotive returns as one of the most popular words in the ngram dataset. Another word is ‘Broadcasting’, 
                      which most likely began to be popularized due to the emergence of the radio in the 1920s. Between 1923 and 1930,
                       60 percent of American families purchased radios(1). Families would gather around and listen to radios for 
                       night-time entertainment. The Airscrew was an aircraft propeller. Metal propellers were produced and popularized
                        for airplanes.

        <p>And this concludes our story of technology from the 1900s to the 2000s. From the invention of the automobile, to the burst of 
          technology from the advent of the Internet, we have watched society evolve into a data-driven, online world.
           These past two decades, technology has become the main focus. This is one of the many stories that the Ngram data has,
