            <p>If you were paying attention in high school English class, you may have noticed that there are just a few differences between Shakespeare's <em>Hamlet</em> and the reddit post about dogs you read the other day while you should have been doing something more productive. While it might be straightforward to recognize that the language of the 1500's isn't the same as it is today, it still might not be obvious exactly <em>how</em> the words we use have changed over time, or perhaps even more interestingly, <em>why</em> they've changed.</p>

            <p>Our team recognized these as interesting questions, and decided to try to answer them, but rather than tell you, we figured we'd show you. Using data from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/datasets/google-books-ngrams/" target="_blank">Google Ngram</a>, we will attempt a meaningful analysis of the millions of words used in centurys of English language books and show you the results, all neatly wrapped up in some pretty visualizations. Our work will focus on a representative body of popular works and will focus on specific phrases that emphasize trends nicely.</p>

                      <p>Sometimes books can offer us a window into the minds of the audience of the times. Often the literature of a period in history is a reflection of the attitudes of the readers of the time, and can offer us some insight into what people were concerned about.</p>

                      <p>Profanity has been a staple of language for quite a while, but what’s been popular over time is interesting. Some words have been around since the beginning of the 19th century, while others entered the lexicon more recently.</p>
                      <p>Also of interest is how swearing in literature has gotten more popular over time. While perhaps not surprising, there’s much to be said for its explosion in popularity in the early 1960’s. This corresponds well with the many art forms that experienced a new freedom of expression.</p>

                      <p>Some changes in English grammar aren’t hard to perceive (not many people go around saying ‘thou’ these days) but there are several more interesting examples of trends present. For example, while it was once common to use the phrase “I’m well” (technically the proper response), you’ll find most people these days using the now synonymous “I’m good” in it’s place. You can also look at how our helping verbs have changed (ought has been supplanted with should or can), or how the use of contractions exploded in the late 1960’s.</p>

                      <p>Analyzing language in text allows us an opportunity to view history through the lens of literature. In these charts, you can see examples of usage of specific words or phrases that pertain to historic events or changes in culture. Beyond an obvious spike initially, it is sometimes noteworthy that certain phrases continue to be relevant, while others dip back into obscurity. Some even have ebbs and flows as their influence continues to resurge.</p>
                      <p>These trends can let us see how the literature of the time reflects what we’re talking about in our everyday lives. It can also let us see how these same conversations fuel authors to continue writing about them long after the initial trend happened.</p>
